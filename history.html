    <p><h3>The History Of Logtime:</h3></p>  
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
       <p><h4> Humble Beginnings:
         It all started when a popular Minecraft Youtuber called IDMC created a Minecraft server for players and modernators alike. It wasn't as popular as Hypixel but was popular enough for people to notice it. The server ran until late 2019 when it shut down.
        Then, suddenly, March 2020 saw a new server created by the Admins and staff members of IDMC called Cubtime. The server came with Custom Survival, Creative and Survival. The Cubtime Discord was created and all seemed well.... Until the owner of Cubtime, Stefatorus, resigns and Zlex took over.
        Zlex was actually a nice person, just didn't talk much. He and the staff team created more gamemodes for Cubtime, which proved to be a failure. Then the inevitable happened, the Cubtime Minecraft Server shut down, leaving the Cubtime Discord alone with just friends.
        A couple of months pass until February 2021, Cubtime Discord server shuts down for good....</h4></p>
       
        <p><h4>Staff Reformation:
        Whilst Cubtime Discord was reaching its death, a secret group was formed to take over the staff team of Cubtime as you see, the original staff weren't helping to make Cubtime more enjoyable. I was part of this group but the others I will not name for the sake of identity. Basically, Jack (the Owner/Manager at the time) had released Staff Applications since @MelonicOverlord was the only proper staff member on at the time.
        Me and Someone else in Staff Reformation applies for staff, and thus the plan began. Me and the other person would basically try to make Cubtime more fun, like the olden days of Cubtime. However, we never got the chance since Cubtime shut down later.</h4></p>
       
        <p><h4>The beginning of a new dawn:
        Whilst everyone was freaking out over the shutdown, me and STEVE429w thought it'll be fun to do a SMP together back on January 2021, ocasionally having our siblings on as well. We started on Aternos cause it was the easiest to do. And we started the SMP
        For a while, it was just us two. But then Cubtime shut down completely, and then Staff Reformation became pointless then. However, we suggested to make the SMP a SMP for old Cubtime players, so we wouldn't miss them. And this created the server Logtime.
       
        <p><h4>Melonsworld:
        Whilst we were stuck on Aternos, MelonicOverlord came to the SMP and said 'I have a spare server you guys can borrow.' We took the gamble and it worked better than Aternos, more people started to join the SMP and Discord server. It looked like Logtime was the new Cubtime. Then something unexpected happened, Melonsworld shut down. However, this was good news for us because this meant we became our own server. Logtime wasn't just a flimsy world borrowing from another server. It was its own independent server.
        And here we are now, expecting Modded Survival and Creative recently released. We don't know what will happen to Logtime in the future. But based on what's going on right now, I think we are better than Cubtime.</h4></p>
